# Customer Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive login and signup functionality for customers with separate customer model handling as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Authentication Controller (`app/controllers/api/v1/authentication_controller.rb`)

#### Key Features Implemented:
- **Role-based Authentication**: Different logic for customer vs admin/delivery_person users
- **Customer-specific Login**: New `customer_login` method that validates against Customer model
- **Automatic Customer Creation**: When role is "customer", both User and Customer records are created during signup
- **Enhanced Token Response**: Returns both user and customer information for customers

#### New Endpoints:
- `POST /api/v1/customer_login` - Dedicated customer login endpoint
- Enhanced `POST /api/v1/login` - Now handles role-based routing
- Enhanced `POST /api/v1/signup` - Creates Customer record for customer signups

### 2. Authentication Logic

#### For Customers:
- Login checks Customer model via User relationship
- Signup creates both User and Customer records
- Token includes both user_id and customer_id
- Response includes customer-specific information

#### For Admin/Delivery Person:
- Login checks User model directly with role validation
- Signup creates only User record
- Token includes user_id only
- Standard user information response

### 3. API Routes Update (`config/routes.rb`)
Added new route:
```ruby
post '/customer_login', to: 'authentication#customer_login'
```

### 4. Updated API Documentation (`API_Documentation.md`)

#### New Documentation Includes:
- Bearer token authorization requirements for all endpoints
- Detailed authentication flow explanation
- Separate examples for customer vs admin/delivery_person authentication
- Request/response examples with proper headers
- Customer signup with required customer fields

## API Usage Examples

### Customer Login
```bash
POST /api/v1/customer_login
{
  "phone": "+919876543220",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

### Customer Signup
```bash
POST /api/v1/signup
{
  "name": "John Customer",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "+919876543220",
  "password": "password123",
  "role": "customer",
  "address": "123 Main St, City",
  "latitude": 12.9716,
  "longitude": 77.5946,
  "phone_number": "+919876543220",
  "preferred_language": "en",
  "delivery_time_preference": "morning",
  "notification_method": "sms"
}
```

### Admin/Delivery Person Login
```bash
POST /api/v1/login
{
  "phone": "+919876543210",
  "password": "password123",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

## Security Features
- JWT tokens with expiration (24 hours)
- Role-based access control
- Secure password authentication using bcrypt
- Customer-specific validation through Customer model

## Database Changes
No schema changes required - utilizes existing User and Customer models with proper relationships.

## Key Benefits
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Customers are validated through Customer model, while admin/delivery staff use User model directly
2. **Enhanced Security**: Role-based authentication prevents unauthorized access
3. **Better UX**: Customer-specific endpoints return relevant customer information
4. **Scalable**: Clean separation allows for future role-specific enhancements
5. **Comprehensive**: All endpoints now properly documented with authorization requirements

## Usage Notes
- All API endpoints (except authentication) now require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Customer login uses dedicated endpoint for better separation
- Customer signup automatically creates both User and Customer records
- Token contains customer_id for customers, enabling efficient customer-specific operations
