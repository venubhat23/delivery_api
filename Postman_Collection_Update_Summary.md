# Postman Collection Update Summary

## Overview
Successfully updated the Postman collection with automatic Bearer token authentication for all APIs and comprehensive endpoint coverage. The collection is now located at `/delivery_api/postman_collection.json` as requested.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Automatic Bearer Token Authentication
- **Primary Auth Token**: Added `auth_token` variable for universal use
- **Role-Specific Tokens**: Maintained `admin_token`, `customer_token`, and `delivery_person_token` for specific roles
- **Collection-Level Authentication**: Set up Bearer token auth at the collection level for automatic inheritance
- **Pre-request Script**: Automatically applies auth token to all requests
- **Test Script**: Automatically extracts and sets tokens from login responses

### 2. ✅ Updated `place_order` API
- **Correct Structure**: Updated to use `items` array format as per the controller implementation
- **Sample Body**: 
  ```json
  {
    "customer_id": {{customer_id}},
    "order_date": "2025-01-07",
    "customer_address": "123 Main St, City",
    "delivery_slot": "morning",
    "items": [
      {
        "product_id": 1,
        "quantity": 2,
        "unit": "liters"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Proper Unit Spelling**: All units corrected to "liters" (not "litres")

### 3. ✅ Updated `subscriptions` API
- **Enhanced Structure**: Added all parameters supported by the controller
- **Sample Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "customer_id": {{customer_id}},
    "product_id": 1,
    "frequency": "daily",
    "start_date": "2025-01-07",
    "end_date": "2025-01-14",
    "quantity": 1.5,
    "unit": "liters",
    "skip_sundays": "true"
  }
  ```

## Technical Implementation

### Collection Structure
- **Version**: 3.0.0
- **Variables**: 8 environment variables including auth tokens
- **Folders**: 8 organized folders with emoji icons
- **Total Endpoints**: 59 comprehensive API endpoints

### Authentication Flow
1. **Login**: User calls any login endpoint
2. **Auto-Extract**: Collection automatically extracts token from response
3. **Auto-Set**: Token is automatically set in `auth_token` variable
4. **Auto-Apply**: All subsequent requests automatically include Bearer token

### Smart Features
- **Collection-Level Auth**: Bearer token inheritance for all requests
- **Pre-request Script**: Automatic token injection
- **Test Script**: Automatic token extraction and variable management
- **Role-Based Tokens**: Separate token variables for different user roles
- **Variable Management**: Automatic setting of `customer_id` and `user_id` from login responses

## Usage Instructions

### Getting Started
1. Import the collection from `/delivery_api/postman_collection.json`
2. Set the `base_url` variable (defaults to `http://localhost:3000`)
3. Use any login endpoint to authenticate
4. Token will be automatically extracted and applied to all requests

### Authentication Flow
1. **First**: Use Customer/Admin/Delivery Person Login
2. **Automatic**: Token extracted and set in `auth_token` variable
3. **Ready**: All other endpoints will automatically use the token

### Key Variables
- `auth_token`: Primary authentication token (auto-managed)
- `customer_id`: Customer ID (auto-set from login response)
- `user_id`: User ID (auto-set from login response)
- `api_base`: Base API URL ({{base_url}}/api/v1)
